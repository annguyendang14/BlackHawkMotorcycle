database idea:

Space(row, col, note, user_id ,price,date_added,avalibility) x
	- avalibility 
		- updated after the day of the conference and open register
		- choice: Reserved, Available, Not Available, Registered
		- using: MySQL event scheduler
	- user_id
		- If space is available for open register or not available, user_id set to null
	
Order(order_id, user_id, payment_type, status, total_price, unpaid_price) x
	-total_price : calculate using OrderLine table, maybe using view for it
	-status: pending, void, authorized, ready_for_shipment, enroute, paid, confirmed, refunded, payment_declined, shipped, archived, awaiting_payment, partial_payment
	
SpaceOrderLine(order_id, row, col, price)
	- price to record the price at time of order, price in space is current price
	
ProductOrderLine(order_id,product_id,price)
	- price to record the price at time of order, price in product is current price

Products(product_id, description, price)
	
Date(year,coference,open_register,pre-register)
User(user_id, login, email, crypted_password, salt, first_name, last_name, middle_initial, nickname) x
Address(addr1,addr2,city,state,country,postal_code,addr_type,prefered, user_id) x
Phone(number, phone_type, prefered, user_id) x
Cart(user_id,space_id,created_at,updated_at) => this will be implemented last, when finishing the actual interface

asking: what information you want to save for user?
	- Multiple address
	- Multiple phone

asking: do they sell anything else aside from conference space?
	- if Yes, how do they want to handle shipping (or pickup)
asking: do they normally have promotional deal? - if yes, needed another table
	promotion_plan(min_quantity,discount,limit,description,discount_type, created_at, updated_at)
