IMPORTANT: SET DEFAULT OF AVAILABILITY OF SPACE - RECHECK WITH MIGRATION WHEN DONE WIL TESTING MILESTONE
IMPORTANT: HIDDEN FIELD IS NOT SAFE -..- HACKER CAN USE IT TO CHANGE WHAT SHOULD BE SET ---- solved



project timeline:

initial prase:
	choosing framework - laravel
	install, reading doumentation => custom registration: http://www.easylaravelbook.com/blog/2015/09/25/adding-custom-fields-to-a-laravel-5-registration-form/
	connect and modify database  => guild: https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-guide-to-using-eloquent-orm-in-laravel
	create initial database data, prepare for first testing 
First testing:p;
	database relationship
	create basic page to access each table 
Complex addition:
	adding event on MySQL that track time to update space avalibility ----------------------------------- PROJECT ARE HERE
	testing that (wonder how - event need to run everyday, keep checking)
	Ecomerce - paypal for now - asking Andy for old code + figure out how to incorporate with laravel
Interface:
	Design the interface
		https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/user-admin-authentication
	Client Testing???? before jumpin insert real data
	Transfer data from old app to new app
	Test Again - in a testing branch and db
Finishing up:
	Deployment - Security concern and testing

	Note: adding alert with option before delete stuff
	validate phone number?

Admin interface:
	See list of vendors who have reserved
	See which vendors paid online and which ones selected that they would pay with cash or check
	Be able to mark vendors who have paid with cash or check as “paid”
	Be able to see list of vendors that have not yet paid
	Set the date when the system opens up for general reservation
	Export a list for printing labels (more info on this forthcoming)
	Add new buildings to the database
	Register on behalf of vendors
	Tie vendors to particular spaces for the limited-access registration time

	
database idea:

Space(row, col, note, user_id ,price,date_added,avalibility) x
	- avalibility 
		- updated after the day of the conference and open register
		- choice: Reserved, Available, Not Available, Registered
		- using: MySQL event scheduler
	- user_id
		- If space is available for open register or not available, user_id set to null
	
Order(order_id, user_id, payment_type, status, total_price, unpaid_price) x
	-total_price : calculate using OrderLine table, maybe using view for it
	-status: pending, void, authorized, ready_for_shipment, enroute, paid, confirmed, refunded, payment_declined, shipped, archived, awaiting_payment, partial_payment
	
SpaceOrderLine(order_id, row, col, price)
	- price to record the price at time of order, price in space is current price
	
ProductOrderLine(order_id,product_id,price)
	- price to record the price at time of order, price in product is current price

Products(product_id, description, price)
	
Date(year,coference,open_register,pre-register)
User(user_id, login, email, crypted_password, salt, first_name, last_name, middle_initial, nickname) x
Address(addr1,addr2,city,state,country,postal_code,addr_type,prefered, user_id) x
Phone(number, phone_type, prefered, user_id) x
Cart(user_id,space_id,created_at,updated_at) => this will be implemented last, when finishing the actual interface

	Model: something about mass assigment =.= not really understand just yet - but for now, dont need to guard any property
	
implement https : https://www.dunebook.com/5-best-security-tips-for-a-laravel-application/
implement admin page: http://laravelcoding.com/blog/laravel-5-beauty-starting-the-admin-area
=>
question: solved
	asking: what information you want to save for user?
		- Multiple address
		- Multiple phone
		- name
		- email
		- cart
		- company_name
		
	asking: do they sell anything else aside from conference space?
		- if Yes, how do they want to handle shipping (or pickup)
	asking: do they normally have promotional deal? - if yes, needed another table
		promotion_plan(min_quantity,discount,limit,description,discount_type, created_at, updated_at)
	asking: handle remove user, what happen to all of that user record?
	asking: can admin assigned order to user? - for now this is not implemented
	asking: behavior of note -> would it available to all user to see for each space?
		how having a note affect the process???
question: unsolved - schedule for later stage of development
	asking: order transaction verification ???? how much important is this? especially with check
		this is probably not needed unless asked
	asking: date system 
	asking: how much should admin be able to control user's addresses and phones, right now admin only can view it
	asking: handle
